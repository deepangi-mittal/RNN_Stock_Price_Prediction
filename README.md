# Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, RNN, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Built and trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Keras to predict stock prices based on historical time-series data.

Preprocessed and normalized stock price data using MinMaxScaler and created time-based sequences for training.

Implemented a many-to-one RNN architecture using stacked layers and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and visualized predicted vs. actual prices to assess forecasting accuracy.

Demonstrated understanding of sequential data modeling and time-dependent patterns in financial datasets.
